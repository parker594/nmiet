# Military AI Simulation Platform - Copilot Instructions

## Project Context
This is a comprehensive military AI simulation platform being developed for a hackathon. The project combines Node.js backend, Python AI models, HTML/CSS/JS frontend, and 3D visualization capabilities.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Socket.io
- **AI/ML**: Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenAI Gym, Computer Vision
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Three.js for 3D visualization
- **APIs**: Google Earth Engine, OpenStreetMap, Weather APIs
- **Security**: JWT authentication, bcrypt, military-grade encryption

## Key Features to Implement
1. Autonomous navigation algorithms for military vehicles
2. Threat detection using computer vision
3. Multi-agent swarm intelligence coordination
4. Real-time 3D terrain visualization
5. Secure commander authentication system
6. API integrations for satellite and weather data

## Development Guidelines
- Follow military-grade security practices
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use async/await for all asynchronous operations
- Maintain clean, documented code
- Focus on real-time performance optimization
- Ensure all APIs are properly authenticated

## File Organization
- Backend controllers handle API endpoints
- AI models are in Python with Flask/FastAPI bridges
- Frontend uses modular JavaScript components
- Security middleware protects all routes
- Configuration files manage environment variables

## Coding Standards
- Use ES6+ features in JavaScript
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Implement proper input validation
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Write comprehensive error handling
- Include inline documentation

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all API endpoints
- Integration tests for AI model pipelines
- Security testing for authentication
- Performance testing for real-time features
- End-to-end testing for user workflows
